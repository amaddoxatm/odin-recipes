        <p>I like Chicken. It's lean, got lots of protein, and it really absorbs the flavor of whatever you put on it. All of my recipes are chicken. If I don't eat chicken, I'll die. I ate ham once and turned into a pig. Never again. Have you seen how they live their life? Just looking for truffles or waiting for slop? Never again. Plus, I like having toes, thank you.</p>
